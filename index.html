<h2 id="characters-heading">Y-you wanna see some [burp] characters, huh? HUH!?!?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p id="characters-intro">As you know, Morty, I've got a lot of enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat. Galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government. Wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses, someone wants a piece of your grandpa. And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem. So a few thousand versions of me had the INGENIOUS IDEA OF BANDING TOGETHER like a herd of cattle or a school of fish, or... those people who answer questions on Yahoo! Answers.</p>
<div></div>

<h2 id="locations-heading">My story begins at the dawn of time in the faraway realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet.</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p id="locations-intro">Ugh... You've got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It's more complicated out here. These are flerbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with 3,000 of these? An entire afternoon at BLIPS AND CHI-I-I-I-I-ITZ!!!!</p>
<div></div>

<h2 id="episodes-heading">Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere. Everyone is going to die, now come watch TV</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p id="epiosdes-intro">Don't break your back creating a lesson, Morty. It's a free-form anthology. I'm getting annoyed you're not hearing that.</p>
<div></div>

<h1 id="charts-heading">Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p id="charts-intro">Now, listenâ€”I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit! Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming, anyways.</p>
